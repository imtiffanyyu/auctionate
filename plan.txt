State the purpose of your application clearly and concisely. Try to do it in a single sentence.
Have an easy way to create and maintain auctions and keep a clear overview.

In a block, answer the following questions:
- What is the problem you are trying to solve? Auction houses currently use a more manual process for maintaining auctions. It seems more complicated than it is. This will allow them to manage their inventory in a better way.
- Who is your target audience? Auction houses
- What are your specific goals? Create a database management system that will allow auction houses to see their inventory, the consigners, and the winning bidders.

In another block, answer the following:
- What is your business model? Where is your revenue coming from? The auction houses would pay to have access to the system.
- What are the costs of your business? Server management of the database, storage of the images.

Market research:
- Who is your current competition? Internal systems that are used.
- How is your product different from currently available competitors?
- What is the current supply / demand for your product?

Technical Specifications:
- What data will you need to store? How will it be organized? Describe each table, its columns, and its relationships with other tables.
- What does your product look like? List each view, their purpose, and how they work
- Describe any complex business logic that is happening in your application. For example, how does data flow through your application

Have a timeline of milestones to reach, including deadlines:
- Create milestones that represent the discrete blocks of functionality.
- Give an estimate for how long each will take per engineer.
- Determine whether things can be built concurrently.
- Come up with a timeline of goals to stick to.
